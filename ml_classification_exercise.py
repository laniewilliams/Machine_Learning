# The Iris dataset is referred to as a “toy dataset” because it has only 150 samples and four features. 
# The dataset describes 50 samples for each of three Iris flower species—Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris 
# virginica. Each sample’s features are the sepal length, sepal width, petal 
# length and petal width, all measured in centimeters. The sepals are the larger outer parts of each flower 
# that protect the smaller inside petals before the flower buds bloom.

#EXERCISE
# load the iris dataset and use classification
# to see if the expected and predicted species
# match up

# display the shape of the data, target and target_names

# display the first 10 predicted and expected results using
# the species names not the number (using target_names)

# display the values that the model got wrong

# visualize the data using the confusion matrix
